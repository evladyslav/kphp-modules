 Development of KPHP â€“ a unique programming language in which the entire backend of VKontakte is written. Expanding the capabilities of the KPHP language by connecting additional libraries using FFI (foreign function interface) technology will make the language more in demand.  Brief summary of the project (general information about the project) In the interests of developing KPHP, a unique programming language in which the entire VKontakte backend is written, a number of works are required to connect support for additional external extensions to KPHP. FFI is a very powerful and underrated technology (and beyond PHP/KPHP too). It allows you to call program libraries written in C from other languages. In particular, to use such libraries in KPHP without modifying the kernel. Such an experience of writing a graphic game and connecting sqlite already exists and exists as an example.. Similarly, you can arrange bindings and examples for other libraries, some of which are even extensions of the PHP language itself. Thus, without reworking the compiler core, it is possible to significantly expand the capabilities of the language.
